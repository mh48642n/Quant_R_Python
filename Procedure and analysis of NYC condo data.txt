First pull data into phpmyadmin and retrieve what I want
- I attmepted to make a database in phpadmin but it wasn't working     so I decided to just pull the data into R instead.
- However I will look at the data in Excel before I use to R to do some mutation of the data

Second look at the data, and decide what information I'd want to correlate and why
- After viewing the data in Excel I decided in the beginning that I wanted to make Neighborhood, Net Income(for all comparables) a regressor  
- I'm going to clean up the data and attempt to view the data for individual neighborhoods instead of each individual observation of condo

Third use R to use the correlation matrix, to determine what has a significant correlation to each other
Fourth make a regression with one dependent variable and two or three independent variables
Fifth determine the regression line equation and run the summary command on that to get t-stat and more
- I'll be making use of the plot function which will give multiple things that I can understand about the data
- I'll also be using the pairs function to get a scatter plot for each regressor so I can understand what the relationship between the y and x is
Sixth make a scatter plot, with a line of best fit
